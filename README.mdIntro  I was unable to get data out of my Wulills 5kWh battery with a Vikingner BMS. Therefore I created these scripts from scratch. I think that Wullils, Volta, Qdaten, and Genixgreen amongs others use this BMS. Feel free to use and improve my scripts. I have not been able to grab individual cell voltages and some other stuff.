Intro

I was unable to get data out of my Wulills 5kWh battery with a Vikingner BMS. Therefore I created these scripts from scratch. I think that Wullils, Volta, Qdaten, and Genixgreen amongs others use this BMS.
Feel free to use and improve my scripts. I have not been able to grab individual cell voltages and some other stuff.
